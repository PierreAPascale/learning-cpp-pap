/*
C++ 
OOO -> based on "Models". You can define an object in many ways, choose what you need to: you don't need a car's number of seats if you're creating racecars
but you need it for a car retailer.

ENCAPSULATION
Only include information about themselves.
Don't include gas price in the car; the gas station would have it.

CLASSES
Classes contain two types of members: data + function
Car.make, Car.paint
Each instance = an object of the class (3 car objects)


ACCESS
Private : accessible only by itself, not even inherited classes
Public : accessible by any other part of the code
Protected : accessible by inherited classes

INHERITANCE AND POLYMORPHISM
Subclasses (class based on another) and superclasses (the class it inherits from)
